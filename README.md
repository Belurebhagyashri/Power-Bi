# Power-Bi
This repository contains my daily Power BI visualization practice examples, where I explore and build a variety of interactive charts, dashboards, and data insights. Each day, I work with different datasets to improve my data storytelling, visualization techniques, and overall Power BI skills.

*The goal of this practice is to:
Strengthen my understanding of Power BI tools and features.
Learn to create impactful and interactive visuals.
Build a personal portfolio showcasing my growth in data visualization 
Whether it's bar charts, slicers, pie charts, line graphs, or KPI dashboards â€” this repository will document my journey of mastering Power BI one chart at a time.
